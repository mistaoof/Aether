# THE AETHER CODEX — Overview & File Map
### Master index for the Aether Power System reference files

**Version:** 2.6
**Status:** Living document — see `codex/changelog.md` for how to extend it
**Notation:** All equations use plain ASCII (no Greek letters, hats, daggers, or special symbols) so they can be typed directly into a manuscript. See the changelog (v1.3 entry) for the legacy symbol mapping if cross-referencing earlier drafts.

## How this reference is organized

The Codex was originally a single document; as of v2.2 it is split into files under `codex/` so each area can be edited and extended independently. **All section (§) and equation (Eq.) numbers are global and unchanged from the single-document versions** — a cross-reference like "§3.5" or "Eq. 4.7" means the same thing everywhere, regardless of which file it appears in. Use the map below to find which file houses any given section.

| File | Contents | Sections | Equations defined |

## Reading order

For a first read, or for onboarding a collaborator: `foundations.md` (why the system works the way it does), then `grand-equation.md` (the formal core and the three axes), then `power-hierarchy.md` (who can do what), then the technique files in tier order — `techniques-novice.md`, `techniques-journeyman.md`, `techniques-adept.md`, `techniques-artisan.md`, `techniques-master.md`, `techniques-warden.md`, `techniques-sovereign.md`, `techniques-legend.md`, `techniques-ascension.md` — with `spell-directory.md` and `glossary.md` as references to consult rather than read straight through.

## Extension conventions

New techniques, refinements, and derivations are appended to the relevant file with a version bump and a one-line summary in `codex/changelog.md`. New equations continue the running global numbering tracked in `codex/glossary.md` (§6). As of v2.3, every rank in the Power Hierarchy — Novice through Legend — has at least one dedicated applied-technique file and at least one formalized equation, and the four Ascent Beyond Legend paths each have a closeness/progress equation in `codex/techniques-ascension.md`. Future growth from here is depth (more Spell Directory entries per rank, deeper derivations) rather than filling gaps in the hierarchy's coverage.
